DESCRIPTION
    MouseX::Types::DateTime creates common Mouse types and coercions for
    dealing with DateTime objects as Mouse attributes.

    Coercions (see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from "Str" and
    "HashRef" to DateTime, DateTime::Duration, DateTime::TimeZone and
    DateTime::Locale objects.

TYPES
  DateTime
        A DateTime class type.

        Coerces from "Num" via "from_epoch" in DateTime.

        Coerces from "HashRef" via "new" in DateTime.

  Duration
        A DateTime::Duration class type.

        Coerces from "Num" via "new" in DateTime::Duration.

        Coerces from "HashRef" via "new" in DateTime::Duration.

  TimeZone
        A DateTime::TimeZone class type.

        Coerces from "Str" via "new" in DateTime::TimeZone.

  Locale
        A DateTime::Locale (see DateTime::Locale::root) class type.

        Coerces from "Str" via "load" in DateTime::Locale.

        Coerces from Locale::Maketext via "load" in DateTime::Locale using
        "language_tag" in Locale::Maketext.
